# Hopfield Neural Networks
A Hopfield neural network (or *Ising model* of a neural network) is a form of artificial *recurrent neural networks* (__RNN__) and a type of *spin glass* system popularised by John Hopfield in 1982. Hopfield networks serve as *content-addressable ("associative") memory* systems with binary threshold nodes, or with continuous variables.
